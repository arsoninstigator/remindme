# remindme
remindme is my first attempt at building a chrome extension for hack club's <b>browser buddy</b> ysws. i came up with this project idea pretty quickly since it was based on my own experience applying to colleges and scholarships this fall. i also created a logo for this project for [#anchor](https://github.com/arsoninstigator/remindme/blob/main/logo/remind-me.png)

## concept
<b>the problem:</b> this extension solves a specific problem for me â€” i come across a lot of scholarships i'm eligible for that only open their applications in the future and have strict deadlines. so, im supposed to take a mental note of when to expect to apply for the specific scholarship and keep them all in my mind on written in a notebook, but the problem is that you can't go through a list of scholarship deadlines everyday to scour for ones that are upcoming to act as a mental reminder (because that would make me go insane), so this extension does this work for you! <br><br>
<b>the solution:</b> it basically solves the hassle of remembering which scholarship applications open at what date and automatically remind you that submissions open for a particular scholarship right before they begin through browser notifications. this also allows you to see upcoming scholarships in ascending order so you know your work load in advance for a specific week and you can also alternatively use this for internship applications or college applications.

## how to run
