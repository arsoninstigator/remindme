# remindme
remindme is my first attempt at building a chrome extension for hack club's <b>browser buddy</b> ysws. i came up with this project idea pretty quickly since it was based on my own experience applying to colleges and scholarships this fall.

## concept
<b>the problem:</b> this extension solves a specific problem for me — i come across a lot of scholarships i'm eligible for that only open their applications in the future and have strict deadlines. so, im supposed to take a mental note of when to expect to apply for the specific scholarship and keep them all in my mind on written in a notebook, but the problem is that you can't go through a list of scholarship deadlines everyday to scour for ones that are upcoming to act as a mental reminder (because that would make me go insane), so this extension does this work for you! <br><br>
<b>the solution:</b> it basically solves the hassle of remembering which scholarship applications open at what date and automatically remind you that submissions open for a particular scholarship right before they begin through browser notifications. this also allows you to see upcoming scholarships in ascending order so you know your work load in advance for a specific week and you can also alternatively use this for internship applications or college applications.

## how to run
1. download the code from this repository and extract the folder from the .zip

5. navigate to the folder you extracted before and select folder
6. you will now be able to see this extension among your other browser extensions and run it


## demo
